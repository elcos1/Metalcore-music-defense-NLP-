Metalcore music is deeper than it might initially seem, let me convince you ;)

I have been an active musician for more than 10 years and I am a huge fan of Metalcore music with bands such as Beartooth or Bring Me The Horizon. 
Sadly, the genre is generally very misunderstood and the message the bands are trying to convey is usually lost in the process. Therefore, I would 
like to dive a little bit into the NLP analysis of lyrics of some of my favorite bands to show how deep the lyrics can be!
